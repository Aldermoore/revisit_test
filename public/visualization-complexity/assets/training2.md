# Complexity examples - *Please read this information carefully*

Before we begin, please have a look at the following examples of simple, intermediate, and complex visualizations. 
**These are not meant as the correct answers to these visualizations, rather as guidelines for how to use the entire scale.**

The following visualization is **considered very simple**. You might want to give it a **score of 1**:

The following visualization is a bit **more complex**, since there are two data series on the same visualization. You could give it a **score of 2 or 3**:

This next visualization is **considered very complex** (we hope you agree), and should probably receive a **score of 10**:

The following *two* visualization are *considered moderately complex*. These you might want to give at least **scores of around 4 or 5**:

The following visualization is **considered intermediately complex**, as it consists of multiple visualizations combined in one view. It should probably receive a **score of around 7**:

**Note:** Many aspects of a visualization can cause it to become more complex; Is the shapes irregular and confusing, are many colors used, is the structure of the visualization confusing, or is the background making it seem more complex? 

Remember that different visualization types can be more complex than others. We are interested in how *you* perceive the complexity of the presented visualizations. These examples are just that, examples.
